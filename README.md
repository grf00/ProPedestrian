Privacy protection based on specific pedestrians.
This project can identify specific pedestrians in images or videos, remove them from the images, and restore them. Thus achieving anonymity of specific pedestriansWith the rapid development of machine learning and the expansion of personal data, various intelligent applications continue to emerge, providing significant value to individuals and society. However, sensitive personal information has raised increasingly serious privacy concerns. Ubiquitous surveillance systems capture a large volume of raw pedestrian images and videos. On one hand, this is useful for legitimate users in many scenarios, such as criminal investigations. On the other hand, these images and videos, stored locally or uploaded to cloud servers, are vulnerable to hackers, posing severe privacy risks to individuals and public safety. Raw images or videos contain sensitive information about pedestrians, such as the true identities of specific individuals or communities. Without careful protection, highly sensitive information could be leaked or misused by malicious parties.

This project focuses on a deep learning-based system for privacy protection of specific pedestrians in surveillance videos. The system can identify individuals in the video and detect those who require privacy protection. The specific individuals can either be extracted from the video or uploaded separately. Once identified, the system removes the individuals from the video and seamlessly fills in the missing areas. It also implements a restoration function that can recover the removed individuals to their original positions in the video. The project enables both pedestrian anonymization and the recovery of anonymized individuals.

## UI界面

The UI interface includes four functions: screenshot, detection, encryption, and decryption

```python
python main.py
```

1. Click the detection button, upload the image, select the pedestrian you want to protect, and save it by default in the yolov7/fast-reid_master/datasets/query folder
2. Click the detection button to jump to the detection interface, upload the folder, and you can detect the pedestrian position in the image and save it by default in the runs/detect3/exp folder
3. Click the encryption button to jump to the encryption interface, upload the folder, and you can protect the pedestrians to be protected in the picture,and save it by default in the example/lama_s_pic folder
4. Click the decryption button to jump to the decryption interface, upload the folder, and you can restore the anonymized image,and save it by default in the example/cover_sec_rec folder

## Packaging plan
```python
pyinstaller -D -w --add-data="./HiNet/*;./HiNet" --add-data="./lama/*;./lama" --add-data="./yolov7/*;./yolov7" main.py
```
## Test

### Profile Path

In the files yolo_fastreid_lama.py、 anony_recory.py and yolov7/yolo_fastreid.py, the.../ replace with one's own actual work path

### Select protected object

Run the image_cut.py file, select the pedestrians to be protected from the original video or image, and capture them. The captured images will be saved to the query folder of the pedestrian re identification module. You can select one or more pedestrians from the picture to capture. After selecting the clipping area, press the ENTER key to save. To exit, do not select any area. Press the ENTER key to exit.

```python
python image_cut.py
```

### Encryption process

1. Put the pedestrian images to be protected into /yolov7/fast-reid_master/datasets/query
2. You can place the image in example/input image and modify the corresponding path in yolo_fastreid_lama.py. Then run yolo_fastreid_lama.py

```python
python yolo_fastreid_lama.py
```
